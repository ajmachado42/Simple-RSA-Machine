# RSA Encryption / Decryption Machine for DS4A Cohort 2.0
-----
Three files that can be run through a command line, order doesn't matter:
- encryption.py: will interact with the user to encrypt a message
- decryption.py: will interact with the user to decrypt a message
- en_de.py: will interact with the user to encrypt and decrypt a message

- A video is included, that I made, for some extra flare :)

- A pdf of the original project prompt from the Python bootcamp with Correlation One is included, also.
